## To start, let’s briefly outline the typical architecture of a three-tier application:

### 1. Presentation Layer (Frontend) 
This is the user interface, usually a web server running HTML/CSS/JS, or a framework like React, Angular, etc.

### 2. Application Layer (Backend) 
The logic of the application resides here, often involving server-side scripts, API services, etc. This could be a Node.js, PHP, or Java application server.

### 3. Data Layer (Database) 
The backend connects to a database where data is stored and managed, often using MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.

## Each tier runs on its own server or instance in AWS in this case. Here’s how we can move through it together:

### Step 1: Set up the Web Tier (Frontend)
We will host your frontend on an AWS EC2 instance. This could be a static website or a dynamic one (e.g., using WordPress).

### Step 2: Set up the Application Tier (Backend)
We will deploy your backend logic (e.g., Node.js or PHP) on a separate EC2 instance, ensuring it can communicate with the frontend.

### Step 3: Set up the Database Tier
The database will also be on a separate EC2 instance, likely using MySQL or any other database, and we’ll ensure proper communication between your backend and the database.

### Step 4: Configure Communication Between Tiers
Each tier needs to be able to talk to each other. This involves setting up the security groups, network rules (VPC, subnets), and possibly load balancers.
